                        <h3>GDSC Web Development Project</h3>
                        <p>
                            The culmination of this project yielded a captivating personal website, hosted on Google Firebase, that seamlessly integrated HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.JS, and Google Firebase. Through meticulous design and development, I crafted a dynamic platform that showcased my skills, passions, and achievements succinctly. Navigating the site was effortless, thanks to its sleek design and intuitive interface. Interactive elements, powered by JavaScript, enhanced user engagement, while React.JS optimized performance and scalability with its component-based architecture. The website served as a comprehensive digital portfolio, encapsulating my dedication to excellence in web development. Its vibrant aesthetic and seamless functionality provided visitors with an immersive experience, leaving a lasting impression of my proficiency and creativity in the ever-evolving realm of web development.</p>

                        <h3>FAC Investment Banking Project</h3>
                        <p>Through this project, I embarked on a deep dive into the intricate workings of investment banking, gaining invaluable insights into the roles of investment bankers and the functioning of investment banking firms. Delving into the nuances of company valuation, asset management, and investment strategies, I honed my analytical skills and financial acumen. A pivotal aspect of the project was a comprehensive case study on aquisition of WhatsApp by FaceBook (presently Meta), meticulously examining their financial reports and balance sheets to understand the underlying factors contributing to this acquisiton. This hands-on experience provided me with practical knowledge and a nuanced understanding of real-world financial challenges. It was a journey of discovery and learning, equipping me with the expertise needed to navigate the complexities of the finance industry with confidence and precision.</p>
